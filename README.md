# ElasticBunny

ElasticBunny is a simply .NET Client for communicating with ElasticSearch.
The client is build on my own needs and experiences with ElasticSearch 8.0.

Originally based on the new concepts in the official Nest client 8.x,
but simplified to suit the needs of every day use and basic usage.
